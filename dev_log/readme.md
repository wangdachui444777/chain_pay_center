# Development Log Guide

Follow these requirements before creating or updating any development log:

1. Read this `readme.md` file in full before making changes.
2. Determine the current date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Log file requirements:

- The log filename must be `YYYY-MM-DD.log`, using the current date only.
- If the file for today does not exist, create it; otherwise append new content to the end of the existing file.
- Write every log entry in English.
- Each appended entry must end with a timestamp accurate to the minute using the format `YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM` (24-hour clock).
- When new findings conflict with earlier notes from the same day, treat the newest information as the source of truth and adjust the current day's log if needed.
- Do not edit logs from any previous date.
- Only correct or revise content within today's log file.
